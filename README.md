# 🧠 CrowdFlowAI: Intelligent Pedestrian Flow Monitoring for Large Gatherings

This project implements an AI-powered system that monitors and analyzes pedestrian flow in crowded gatherings like the Kumbh Mela. It uses deep learning for detection and multi-object tracking to analyze crowd movement and potential stampede risks.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Mass gatherings pose a high risk of uncontrolled pedestrian flow and stampede-like conditions. This system aims to:

- Detect and count pedestrians in real-time.
- Track individual and collective movements.
- Simulate panic scenarios.
- Detect early signs of stampedes using flow analysis and anomaly detection.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshay9024/Group53_CrowdFlowAI.git
cd CrowdFlow
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
```

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download Model Weights

Place the following model file in the `models/` directory:

- `head_medium.pt`: [Download here](https://github.com/Abcfsa/YOLOv8_head_detector/raw/main/medium.pt)

Also ensure `yolov8n.pt` is available via `ultralytics`.

## ▶️ How to Run

### Using Jupyter Notebook

1. Open `head_detection.ipynb` in Jupyter or Colab.
2. Ensure that:
   - Input videos are in the `videos/` folder.
   - Paths are correctly set in the code:  
     - `input_folder = "videos"`  
     - `output_folder = "output_videos"`

### Output

- Tracked videos will be saved in `output_videos/`
- A `tracking_log.csv` file will be generated for further analysis.
